----------------------------------------
don't round
t = 1.23345
print(f"Finished in {t:.2f}s")
----------------------------------------
Always convert to numpy right away and continue to use numpy functions like np.min and np.max
----------------------------------------
Use super(f).function() more
 
use :=

dictionary.get(key,default value) - avoids errors
dict.setdefault(key,default value) - will set a value if not found

-----------------Things to do-------------------
create function to fill points in each stock. Would fill a whole year of points.

Add the ablility to mouseover the stock graph and have it show the price & date (12/2/23)

improve performance in stockbook - likely due to making lots of rects each frame
    and in portfolio, need a similar thing to the stock class with caching renders for text

the selector in stockbook fails when the stock price moves, it is stored as a quantity not as the index
    when the quantity changes then it doesn't highlight it (12/10/23)

the words in portfolio for the stock name should have a variable lenght for the polygon.
