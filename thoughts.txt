----------------------------------------
don't round
t = 1.23345
print(f"Finished in {t:.2f}s")
----------------------------------------
Always convert to numpy right away and continue to use numpy functions like np.min and np.max
----------------------------------------
Use super(f).function() more
 
use :=

dictionary.get(key,default value) - avoids errors
dict.setdefault(key,default value) - will set a value if not found

-----------------Things to do-------------------
create function to fill points in each stock. Would fill a whole year of points.

Add the ablility to mouseover the stock graph and have it show the price & date (12/2/23)

improve performance in stockbook - likely due to making lots of rects each frame
    and in portfolio, need a similar thing to the stock class with caching renders for text

the selector in stockbook fails when the stock price moves, it is stored as a quantity not as the index
    when the quantity changes then it doesn't highlight it (12/10/23)

improve performance in portfolio, none of the texts are cached (including the pie chart) 

add the option to sell in the portfolio (12/14/23)
    click on the stock and it expands the polygon wiht a sell button below
    -Also add some sort of number next to each stock so it makes more sense when it is scrolling

move the ui controls on the top of the stock view to the bottom and replace the top with the time (12/14/23)

Make the polygons look better and longer in stockbook on the left side (12/14/23)
