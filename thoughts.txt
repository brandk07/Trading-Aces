----------------------------------------
don't round
t = 1.23345
print(f"Finished in {t:.2f}s")
----------------------------------------
Always convert to numpy right away and continue to use numpy functions like np.min and np.max
----------------------------------------
Use super(f).function() more
 
use :=

dictionary.get(key,default value) - avoids errors
dict.setdefault(key,default value) - will set a value if not found

text = 'Heloo'
rev = slice(None,None,-1)
print(text[rev])
// ooleH

def __format__(self, format_spec) -> str:
    match format_spec:
        case 'time':
            return f"dklf"
        case 'case':
            return f"this"
        case _:
            return ValueError(f"Unknown specifier for object") 
then you can do f"{object:caps}"

currying-
def multiply_setup(a):
    def multiply(b):
        return a * b 
    return multiply

double = multiply_setup(2)
triple = multiply_setup(3)

double(5)# 10
triple(7)# 21

Never use a mutable type as a default parameter (it will always use the same list otherwise) ie..
def appendtolist(elements,target=[]):
    ....
set none then check instead
def appendtolist(elements,target=None):
    if target is None:
        target = []

you can use the exec() to run strings as code exec("print('hello')")

enumerate can start at a specific num if you give it a second parameter enumerate(iterable, start)
