# Trading Aces

A fast, arcade‑style stock sim with a slick live graph, instant startup, and smart resolution scaling.

## Quick start
- Install Python 3.10+ and pip
- Install Pygame:

Important: run LaunchGAME.py, not Main.py. The launcher handles instant startup, resolution detection, mouse scaling, and then boots the game.



## Game Controls
- Speed controls (top‑right):
  - Reverse, Pause, Play, Fast‑forward
- Must naviate through menus in-game to buy/sell stocks and options

## Troubleshooting
- Missing asset warnings at launch: make sure the `Assets/` folder is intact
- Black screen or no input:
  - Confirm Pygame is installed
  - Run from the project root (`Trading-Aces-2`)
